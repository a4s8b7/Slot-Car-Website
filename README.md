# Slot-Car-Website
uh the code for the website

To be designed as a Central Location for all things Slot Car

Want to have an easy to navigate menu 

Catagories with sub catagories, Have the image in the menu change to help show what catagory you are in.

Main things to focus on would be:
	* Racing schegules future and past. 
	* Race Scores and standings
	* Advertising for local hobby shops and tracks

Usser generated content
	* users can make accounts
	* they can create a profile with info that can be used to make a baseball card style card.

	* users can post pictures

Main catagories are by Scale:

	* 1/24 scale

sub catagories:

Races would have some sub catagories: (these will be spicific to scale)

	* Series racing
	* Open race nights
